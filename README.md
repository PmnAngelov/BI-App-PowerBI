The above data model is of type star schema. The data is imported into PowerBI from an SQL Server database - "WideWorldImporters". In order to optimize the data experience, I created a new schema and five data views, since not only are views good for defining a table without using extra storage, but they also accelerate data analysis and can provide the data extra security.
